  * Software as a service (SaaS) is a major sector of cloud computing business. To thrive in this competitive market, growing user base and preventing user churn are crucial for business. To help a company quickly adapt its product to meet usersâ€™ needs, it is important to develop a model that can predict customer decision.  
  * Performing sentiment and text analysis on user communication data can be an effective approach to reflect user experience or satisfaction level. A prediction algorithm based on the sentiment and text analysis can predict when a user is about to subscribe or unsubscribe. The client of this consulting project is a startup company specializing on a fitness app designed for runners. The data are generated from user communication in-app.  
  * Several features were extracted from the text data, including sentiment, number of characters, number of words, etc. A classification model was trained using these features, which can predict nearly 100% user conversions within the free-trial period.
