  * Software as a service (SaaS) is a major sector of cloud computing business. To thrive in this competitive market, growing user base and preventing user churn are crucial for business. To help a company quickly adapt its product to meet usersâ€™ needs, it is important to develop a model that can foretell customer behavior.  
  * Performing sentiment and text analysis on user communication data is an effective approach to reflect user experience or satisfaction level. A scoring system based on the sentiment and text analysis can predict when a free-trial user is about to become a paid subscriber and when a user is about to leave.   
  * This predictive model can help a company developing effective marketing strategy to target users. Consequently, the revenue is expected to be improved by reducing the churning rate and increasing the conversion rate.
