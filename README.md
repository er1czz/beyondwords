## Executive Summary
  * Software as a service (SaaS) is a major sector of cloud computing business. To thrive in this competitive market, growing user base is a crucial drive of business. Predicting and understanding customer decision are imperative to help a company timely adapt its service to meet usersâ€™ needs.  
  * Performing sentiment and text analysis on user communication data can be an effective approach to reflect user experience or satisfaction level. An algorithmic approach based on the user text data was carried out to predict when a user is about to subscribe or unsubscribe. The client of this consulting project is a startup company specializing in platforms designed for content creators to create their mobile apps. The data are generated from user communication in-app.  
  * 60 features were extracted from the text data with timestamp, including sentiment, number of characters, number of words, etc. A model was trained based on these features to predict user decision. Specifically, this model predicted both user churn and bounce events with near 0.9 and 0.8 accuracy, respectively. Key factors such as number of character typed by users at different time were identified. Additional time-series analysis reavealed a possible life cycle of user engagement. Therefore, this algorithmic approach can facilitate the development of marketing strategies for client to grown and retain the premium user base through trial promotions and in-app perks (A/B testing would be recommended).

## Key Procedures
1. **Preprocessing text data for machine to read**
    - Converte emoji and emoticon by [*emoji*](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/) and [*emot*](https://github.com/NeelShah18/emot) packages, respectively.
    - Note: although [*emot*](https://github.com/NeelShah18/emot) can also process emoji, its emoji database is not as comprehensive as [*emoji*](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

2. **Choosing the right natural language processing (NLP)models**
    - Test unsupervised NLP: [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io) and [VADER](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html)
    - Test supervised NLP: off-the-shelf pretrained [BERT (state-of-the-art)](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html#transformers.pipeline)
    - Highly skewed data: user text contents were overwhelmingly positive and supportive, unsuitable for existing unsupervised models or off-the-shelf supervised models.
 
3. **Tuning BERT model with proper labelling**
    - Create two type of labels for each text: Tone (positive/neutral/negative) and Content (rich/partial/none)
    - Fine-tune two BERT models through [ktrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10703) for each label class separately
    - Achieved accuracy score 0.85 and 0.78 for Tone and Fact, respectively
    - Note: another approach is to merge two label classes into one (2x3) to train one model (less costly but weakned prediction: accuracy score 0.67 due to data imbalance)
 
4. **Predicting user churn and bounce**
    - Only use text data generated before user decisions
    - Extract text features, including words, characters, as well as their average by comment number for each user
    - Combine text features and sentiment features (60 features)
    - Apply a stacking classifier (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ridge combined by Logistic Regression)
    - Achieved 0.87 and 0.76 accuracy for churn and bounce, respectively.

5. **Takeaways** 
   - Strong correlation between text and sentiment features
   - - text features are good enough to predict user decision (easy to scale up)
   - User engagement level is a key indicator of user decision
   - Churned user data imply that user engagement has an average life cycle of 8 months 
   - Recommend A/B testing on app features that faciliate user communication, which can reveal the causation.
